Lab 2: Lists and Loops

Always check the lab code on both the VM and in CSIL!

Changes from A'15:

1. Added a reference to the "Using an editor" section of lab.  The
   lab1 link works when the HTML is generated from 12100, but not from
   the lab2 sphinx directory.  Is there a way to fix this problem?

2. Changed exercise #5 in loops to require the computation of M.

3. Changed step 6 in integration task from print to return to
   avoid future confusion.

4. Added enumerate to the loops decription.

5. Fixed an error in the list description.
